# Introduction

Text+ offers custom fonts inside of Roblox.\
Any font file (`.ttf` and `.otf`) can be used to render text using Text+.

It uses just one image per font (weights and styles count as individual fonts).

Don't worry, the process is mostly automated for you with a combination of an external and a custom tool of mine, so it'll be easy for you to setup many awesome fonts!
