# Data module

Custom fonts are stored in a separate module.

Create a new module and name it whatever you want â€” `Fonts` is recommended.\
It's crucial that you give it the [tag](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/properties#instance-tags) `Fonts`, so that Text+ can identify it.

The fonts data module has to return a table, like this:

```lua
return {
	
}
```
