# Transform and style

All characters are instances, that can be directly modified.

* **Roblox fonts:** TextLabels
* **Custom fonts:** ImageLabels

This means that you can modify and animate them however you want.\
That's where the creativity plays in — be creative!

{% hint style="info" %}
For animating, [Tween+](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/3599638) is highly recommended, as it allows for more advanced and customizable animations than TweenService and other alternatives — additionally it includes efficient networking and overall optimization, making it ideal for any use-case.
