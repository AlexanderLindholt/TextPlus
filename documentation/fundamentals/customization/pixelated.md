# Pixelated

`Pixelated` is one of the many customization options.

It expects a boolean.

If a custom font is used, and this option is enabled, the ImageLabels that make up each character will have their [`ResampleMode`](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/resamplemode-new-property-for-image-gui-objects/1418681) set to `Pixelated`.
