# Truncation

`Truncate` is one of the many options.

### When enabled:

When text exceeds the boundaries and can no longer fit within the frame, it will intelligently find/make enough space for `...` at the end.

For example: `Hello there!` might become `Hello the...` in certain scenarios.

The dots (called an ellipsis) indicates that there is more text out of sight.
