# Minimum- and maximum-size

`MinimumSize` and `MaximumSize` are two size-limit options.

Both options are numbers, that are pixel amounts even though scale-size is enabled.\
You don't have to provide both, or even any.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These are only for when scale-size is enabled.
{% endhint %}
